## Tone Guidelines

| Content Type | Tone |
|--------------|------|
| Glossary | Educational, clear, technical but accessible |
| Location pages | Professional, locally relevant, reassuring |
| Industry pages | Expert, sector-aware, compliance-focused |
| Compliance guides | Authoritative, practical, step-by-step |
| CVE pages | Technical, urgent where appropriate, actionable |

## Writing Style

### DO
- Use active voice: "Attackers exploit this vulnerability" not "This vulnerability is exploited"
- Be specific: "SQL injection in the login form" not "a security issue"
- Include examples: "For instance, the 2023 MOVEit breach..."
- Use second person: "You should..." / "Your organisation..."
- Break up text with headers, lists, code blocks

### DON'T
- Use AI patterns: "Additionally", "Furthermore", "It's important to note", "In conclusion"
- Use em dashes excessively
- Start sentences with "This"
- Use superlatives without evidence: "the best", "the most secure"
- Be vague: "enhance your security posture"
