# {CVE-ID}: {Vulnerability Name}

| | |
|---|---|
| **CVE ID** | {CVE-ID} |
| **CVSS Score** | {score} ({severity}) |
| **Affected** | {product/vendor} |
| **Published** | {date} |
| **Exploited in Wild** | {Yes/No/Unknown} |

## Summary

{2-3 sentence summary:
- What the vulnerability is
- What it allows an attacker to do
- Why it's significant}

## Affected Systems

{List affected products/versions:
- Product name and vulnerable versions
- Patched versions
- End-of-life products that won't receive patches}

**Vulnerable:**
- {Product} versions {X} through {Y}
- {Product2} versions {A} through {B}

**Fixed in:**
- {Product} version {Z}+

## Technical Details

{Technical explanation:
- Vulnerability class (RCE, SQLi, XSS, etc.)
- Attack vector (network, local, etc.)
- Prerequisites for exploitation
- Technical mechanism (without providing exploit code)}

## Exploitation Status

{Current threat status:
- Is it being exploited in the wild?
- Are there public exploits/PoCs?
- Which threat actors are using it?
- CISA KEV status if applicable}

{WebSearch "{CVE-ID} exploit" and "{CVE-ID} in the wild" for current status}

## Remediation

### Immediate Actions

1. **Patch**: {Specific patch/update to apply}
2. **Workaround**: {If patch not possible, temporary mitigation}
3. **Detection**: {How to check if you're affected}

### Detection Methods

```bash
# Example detection command if applicable
{command to check version or vulnerability}
```

### Indicators of Compromise

{If exploitation leaves traces:
- Log entries to look for
- File artifacts
- Network indicators}

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| {date} | Vulnerability discovered |
| {date} | Vendor notified |
| {date} | Patch released |
| {date} | Public disclosure |
| {date} | Exploitation observed (if applicable) |

## Content Rules

1. **Length**: 400-600 words
2. **Language**: Technical, precise
3. **Research**: MUST WebSearch for:
   - "{CVE-ID} exploit" - exploitation status
   - "{CVE-ID} patch" - remediation details
   - "{CVE-ID} affected versions" - scope
4. **Accuracy**: Verify CVSS score and affected products from NVD
5. **Timeliness**: Note if information may change

## Priority CVEs to Cover

Focus on:
- CVSS 7.0+ (High and Critical)
- CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
- Widely deployed software (Microsoft, Apache, Linux kernel)
- Recent (last 12 months) high-profile vulnerabilities

## What to Avoid

- Providing working exploit code
- Speculation about unconfirmed exploitation
- Outdated remediation advice
- Missing the "exploited in wild" status
- Copying NVD description verbatim
